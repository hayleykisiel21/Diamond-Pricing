# Diamond-Pricing

A statistically significant model is created in order to predict the price of a Blue Nile diamond. 

## Description

A multi-linear regression analysis is ran using data reported from the Blue Nile Diamond company which includes price and the “4 C’s” of diamonds: carat, cut, clarity, and color. These four factors of the diamond were evaluated for significance and interactions to determine which factors were significant and influential when used to predict the final price of a diamond.
